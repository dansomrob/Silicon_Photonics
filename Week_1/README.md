# Week 1 - Photonic Components

In the first week of the course we explore photonic components.

The most important idea is that of the waveguide. These are etched into a silicon layer, and surrounded by silicon dioxide.

As Silicon has a greater refractive index (3.47) than Silicon Dioxide (1.44), most of the light will travel through the Silicon.

The jupyter notebook 'ng_vs_n.ipynb' plots the different in the refractive index and the group index.

The jupyter notebook '1d_waveguide.ipynb' plots the modes of a silicon waveguide depending on thickness and mode (TE or TM). 

We then explore Y-Branchs, the silicon equivalent of an beam splitter.
