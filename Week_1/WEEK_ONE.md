## Waveguides

The jupyter notebook 'ng_vs_n.ipynb' contains a recreation of MATLAB code provided in the course to compare the refractive index of Silicon to its group index.

The jupyter notebook '1d_waveguide.ipynb' is also a recreation of MATLAB code which has as inputs the slab thickness and which mode (TM or TE) and plots the mode.
